 Summary Insight – Retail Customer Analysis
* Objective: The manager seeks an overview of customer spending and behavior from Dec 2009 – Dec 2011 to:
- Evaluate spending contributions from new, retention, and reactivated customers.
- Provide strategic recommendations for customer acquisition and retention.

* Data Limitation: The dataset is incomplete from the starting date → results reflect indicative trends only.

* Key Findings
Revenue & Orders
- Total spending: $18M with 37K orders.
- Sales peaked during year-end months, with an average order value of nearly $600 (overall average: $480).
Customer Behavior
- The majority of spending comes from existing customers, with Retention > Reactivated.
- Retention customers consistently generates the highest value. 
For example, in Nov 2010: Retention: ~$1K/customer per month, New: ~$0.4K/customer, Reactivated: ~$0.5K/customer
- New customer growth is unstable, and their GMV contribution declines over time.
 Cohort Analysis
- New customers acquired in Dec 2010 showed very low retention in the following months (<10%) → indicating an ineffective campaign.
- New customers in Jun 2011 had weaker retention compared to adjacent months → high churn risk.

*Strategic Recommendations
- Seasonality: Leverage year-end demand to maximize GMV through upselling & cross-selling.
- Retention: Allocate ~70% of marketing budget to existing customers → loyalty programs, turning reactivated customers into retention customers.
- Acquisition: Invest ~30% in new customer acquisition → referral campaigns, multi-channel advertising.
- Cohort Deep Dive: Further analyze New Dec 2010 and New Jun 2011 cohorts to refine onboarding strategy.
