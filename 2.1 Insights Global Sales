# 📊 Summary Insight – Retail Customer Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
The manager seeks an overview of customer spending and behavior from **Dec 2009 – Dec 2011** in order to:

- Provide strategic recommendations for **customer acquisition and retention**.

## ⚠️ Data Limitation
The dataset is incomplete from the starting date → results reflect **indicative trends only**.

## 🔑 Key Findings  

### 1. Revenue & Orders  
- Total spending: **$18M** with **37K orders**.  
- Sales peaked during **year-end months**, with an average order value of nearly **$600** (overall average: **$480**).  

### 2. Customer Behavior  
- The majority of spending comes from **existing customers**, with **Retention > Reactivated**.  
- **Retention customers consistently generate the highest value.**  
  - Example (Nov 2010):  
    - Retention: **~$1K/customer per month**  
    - New: **~$0.4K/customer**  
    - Reactivated: **~$0.5K/customer**  
- **New customer growth is unstable**, and their GMV contribution **declines over time**.  

### 3. Cohort Analysis  
- **New customers acquired in Dec 2010** showed very low retention in the following months (<10%) → indicating an **ineffective campaign**.  
- **New customers in Jun 2011** had weaker retention compared to adjacent months → high **churn risk**.

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendations  
- **Seasonality**: Leverage year-end demand to maximize GMV through **upselling & cross-selling**.  
- **Retention**: Allocate ~70% of marketing budget to **existing customers** → loyalty programs, turning reactivated customers into retention customers.  
- **Acquisition**: Invest ~30% in **new customer acquisition** → referral campaigns, multi-channel advertising.  
- **Cohort Deep Dive**: Further analyze **New Dec 2010** and **New Jun 2011 cohorts** to refine onboarding strategy.
